# Privacy_Policy_Text_Analysis

Today, privacy policies provide a legal framework for companies to collect data produced by customer interactions with their services. 
In recent years, with growing concerns about data privacy, privacy policies are becoming increasingly important to both consumers and service providers. 
However, there is limited research on the American leading companiesâ€™ privacy policies. 
With these dynamics in mind, the purpose of this study is to investigate the aforementioned companies' privacy policies. 
This paper also attempts to answer the three following questions: (1) Which privacy-policy-related words and key phrases are frequently mentioned? 
(2) Which privacy-policy-related words and key phrases do top 5 companies use? (3) Are there any consistencies in the positive or negative language used among the privacy policies of these companies? 
The study utilizes inductive and deductive methodologies to look into each privacy policy and follow Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) data science process to conduct an effective and comprehensive project.
